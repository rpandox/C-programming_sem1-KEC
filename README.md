                    A typical interaction may be as follows:
                    DEPARTMENTAL STORE 
                    S.N.    Item    Price(Rs.)
                    1       Bread   30

                Please enter your choice(1,2 or 3): 1   
                Quantity(nos.): 3
                The total cost of your choice will be Rs. 90.

LABORATORY SESSON 5 - Functions



    one
        # a program to create a user defined function that finds the factorial of a number entered by the user which takes argument. The result must be displayed in the main function.
    
    two
        # a program to create a number of user defined functions that takes arguments to find the areas of rectangle and circle. The result must be displayed from main.

    three
        # a program to calculate the permutation and combination for given n and r. The permutation and combination are defined for given n and r as:
            P(n, r) = n!/(n-r)!
            C(n, r) = P(n,r)/r!
            Define a function factorial, P and C to calculate above requirements.
