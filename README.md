LABORATORY SESSON 1 - Basic Input Output
        one
            # a program using printf () and different escape sequences to give the output

                    First Name      Middle name     Marks 
                    ............    ............    ...... 
                            NOTE : < 30 'Fail'

        two
            # a program which requests a user to enter a weight in kg. The program converts it in pounds (kg = 2.2 pounds)
        three
            # a program to read three numbers x, y and z to compute the values of a, b and c given by:
                a) a = x+|y -z|     b)  b = sin^-1(√((x^2 + y^2)/2))    c) c = (x-z)^4/3
        four
            # a program to accept temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it into degrees Celsius
        five
            # a program to read the radius of a circle and to compute its area and circumference. Use a symbolic constant to define the value of π.


LABORATORY SESSON 2 - Selective Structures
        one
            # a program that reads a co-ordinate point of rectangle coordinate system and displays the
            the appropriate message after checking where the point lies on the co-ordinate system.
        two 
            # a program to find the taxable amount of an employee.

                a. No tax up to 1,00,000 per annual income
                b. 15% tax for 1,00,000 to 1,75,000 per annual income
                c. 25% tax for greater than 1,75,000 per annual income
        three
            # a program to read a positive integer n and check weather a number is odd or even using switch case
