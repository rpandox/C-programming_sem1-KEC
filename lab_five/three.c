/*
a program to calculate the permutation and combination for given n and r. The permutation 
          and combination are defined for given n and r as:
            P(n, r) = n!/(n-r)!
            C(n, r) = P(n,r)/r!
            Define a function factorial, P and C to calculate above requirements.
